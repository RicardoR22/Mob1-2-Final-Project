# Mob1-2-Final-Project

An app for tracking Anime that you've watched or plan to watch. You can set anime title, completion status [not started, watching, completed], and give a rating.

On the initial screen you see all the anime that you've added in a table. You can swipe left on an anime cell for the delete option, and swipe right for an edit option.

Future updates may include an api integration which would allow for searching of anime to add.
